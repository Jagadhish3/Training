//difference between static method and static block
//A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to any specific instance of the class. 
//      It can be called without creating an instance of the class. Static methods can access static variables and 
//      other static methods directly, but they cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly because 
//      they do not belong to any particular object.

//A static block, also known as a static initialization block, 
// is a block of code that is executed when the class is loaded into memory. 
// It is used to initialize static variables or perform any setup that needs to be done once for the class. 
// Static blocks are executed only once, when the class is first loaded, before any static methods or instance methods are called.

//can we overload main method in java?
// //Yes, we can overload the main method in Java. Overloading the main method means creating multiple
// methods with the same name "main" but with different parameter lists (different types or number of parameters).
// However, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) always looks for the specific signature public static void main(String[] args)
// to start the execution of a Java program. Therefore, while you can overload the main method, only the standard main method will be used as the entry point of the program.

How to create object?
->by using new keyword
->new ClassName();


what is new?
->new is a keyword
->it is unary operator
->with the help new keyword we can creat n numbers of object for one clas.
->It will return address of an object.
->Whenever we are using new keyword new object will be created.

ClassName is a non primitive datatype which is used to store address of an object.

How to use non static members inside static context ?
->With the help of object reference variable.
***NOTE:-Every object is directly pointing towards class static area***

whenever we have non static variable and local variable with same name ,
if we use directly inside non static context the high priority is given for local variable.
to use static variable we have to use this .
 this:
    this is keyword
    it is a non static reference variable,
    it is used to store address of current object
    it can be used only inside non static context
